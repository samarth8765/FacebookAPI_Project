# Dependencies
We have to install following python packages for our project:
->facebook-sdk
->requests

# FacebookGraphApi
A small project where I play around with Facebook's graph api.

## Connect.py
This script contains functions to get FB token or graph.

## Group.py
This script contains a function called 
`get_group_post_attachments` that looks into a facebook group
specified by the ID in the config.py file and it returns a 
list containing all the posts with a video. This function can 
be used to check whether in a group a video has been posted in
a given period. This is a functionality currently missing in 
Facebook.
